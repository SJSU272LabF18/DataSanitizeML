## Idea 1

Search engine for an online market
   
### Project description:  
Nowadays, online shopping is becoming popular, but to match what the customers exactly want is a challenge, due to the customers do not know the exact name of the items or they only know how to descript it by natural language. 
Our project is to build a search engine for online shopping website, the goal is to maintain a database for all items information of  an online market (By crawler),  when the user input some words, the system is able to process Natural Language and reply a list with matched items.

   
### Proposed methodology/ resources:

## Idea 2
### Project title:   
CURD database web server
 
### Project description:  
With the data size increasing, it becoming harder to maintain the database which contains associated tables, a little change of one value may need plenty of time to update the whole databases. Our project is to implement a server with Web UI that allows the user to manage the database with CURD (create, read, update and delete) panel and can easily deal with associated tables. Plus, we provide the GUI which allow non-engineering background user can easily maintain the database.  
 
### Proposed methodology/ resources:  
`Laravel`  `Backpack` `MySQL`

## Idea 3
### Project title:
Configurable Notification Web System

### Project description:
Implement a notification system that notify users about a post or news they are looking for on a website with some user input keywords. The system is designed to be suitable for all kinds of website(news, blogs, online store, forum, etc), and user can enter several websites with some keywords to match the information they want. The notification system will use a open source web crawler to keep finding the information on these chosen websites regularly(ex. every 1 hour), and give notice and web link to user when there is a match.
This notification application can be used for situations like finding used-car, room for rent,  online flea market or updated new post, etc. With all the user and item data, we can later do some analysis for marketing uses,  like the most wanted item, etc. 


### Proposed methodology/ resources: 
`Heritrix(open source crawler)` `MySQL` `Nosql` `Servlet`
