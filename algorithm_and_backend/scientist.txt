The expedition was designed to demonstrate that ancient people could have made long sea voyages, creating contacts between separate cultures. This was linked to a diffusionist model of cultural development. Heyerdahl subsequently made other voyages designed to demonstrate the possibility of contact between widely separated ancient people, notably the Ra II expedition of 1970, when he sailed from the west coast of Africa to Barbados in a papyrus reed boat.

Although Lorenz did not discover the topic, he became widely known for his descriptions of imprinting as an instinctive  bond. In 1936 he met Tinbergen, and the two collaborated in developing ethology as a separate sub-discipline of biology. A Review of General Psychology survey, published in 2002, ranked Lorenz as the 65th most cited scholar of the 20th century in the technical psychology journals, introductory psychology textbooks, and survey responses.[2]

scientist^^id,name,detail^^80>>Peter Kubelka>>Kubelka made 16mm films, mostly shorts, and is known for his 1960 film Arnulf Rainer, a ""flicker film"" which alternates black and clear film that is projected to create a ""flicker"" effect.  Kubelka also designed the Anthology Film Archives custom film screening space in the 1970s in New York.  The theater had highly raked (tiered) seating with a cowel over each seat and visual barriers between each seat so that the audience member was totally isolated visually from other patrons.  The theater was painted black and the seating was covered in black velvet.  The only light in the room between film showings came from a spotlight aimed at the screen, thus ensuring that the only light in the room came from the screen.  The design is illustrative of the purist aesthetic of the Avant Garde film movement of that era.
